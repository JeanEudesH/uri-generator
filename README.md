# Readme  

## Get started  

A get started page is avaliable within the app to help you use it correctly.

## URI generator  

This is a python application using Flask framework.
In order to run this application you should clone this repository.  
Open it using VScode (or an other software) set a python terminal and run the following commands :  

``` python
export FLASK_APP=app.py
python3 flask run
```

The app uses the default name app.py

You will need to install the appropriate libraries. To do so *conda* environment or *venv* are suitable.  
*(can you read the environment linked to this project?)*

## Adapt it  

The generator is using *jinja2* templates, it improves a base template named generator.html using :  

```python
{% extends "generator.html" %}
{% block title %}
```

To make use of this generator for your own instance, you can replace generator.html with your own page (using your own design).
