        <i>How to use this application, how to test it with examples and how to use it for generating URIs in your own installation? </i>
        
        <br>
        <h3>1. Initialize account</h3>
        If you just want to have a go, <a href="login"> log in</a> as TEST user :<br>
        username: test <br>
        password: test
        <br> <br>
        If you want to use the application, for your installation, go to : <a href="new_user">Create your account</a>. 
    </p>
    <h3>2. Using the application for testing URI generation for different objects.</h3>
    <p style="width:800px"> 
        It is recommended to perform several tests before creating your own URIs<br>
        In this case (test) log in with test details (test/test).<br>
        The <a href="your_database">last database URI</a> menu, summarize the last URIs granted by your collegues for each object type.
        
    </p>
    <p style="width:800px">
        
        To create URIs go to : <a href="import_dataset">Generate URI</a> <br>
        Find hereby an example of data for all the objects types handled. They are meant to show you what is the format expected, and allow you to perform tests. <br>
        Click to download.

    <i>The returned file is by default in your "download" folder under the name "export_URI_plant.csv" (plant/sensors/...).</i>

    <h3>3. Generate URI for your own installation.</h3>
    <p align="justify" style="width:800px">
        You need to create files that describes objects in your installation, for each category of objects you are interested in. 
        They need to have the same format as in the corresponding object category in examples (ยง2 above).  <br>
        The file needs a first line with a header (name of colomns), followed by one row per individual (e.g. plant 1, plant 2, etc). 
        Each line represents a particular object (e.g. one plant or one sensor), each column contains the required information for creating the URI.  
        Each column contains variables applying to the considered objects (label, genotype, variety, etc). 
        The expected format for the file is a "csv" with commas (,) as a delimiter between fields. 
    </p>
    <h4>Non conventionnal structure</h4>
    <p align="justify" style="width:800px">
        
        If your file contains comments at the beginning, for example "Data acquired on the 15/05/2020, by Jean-Michel Saumon" you 
        can skip this row using the argument in the "Details" section. <br>
        <i>As a rule,  do not insert metadata in the file itself, better insert them in a separate file and link the two files, this will avoid you a lot of problems</i> <br>
        The expected format for the table is the "csv" format, a classic format to manipulate data, this is very simple (just text) and 
        use the comma (,) as a delimiter between fields. 
        If you are not using the classic delimiter you can specify it in the "Details" section.
    </p>
    <h4>Recover your URIs and check them</h4>
    <p align="justify" style="width:800px">
        
        You can check what was the last value given to your uri in the <a href="your_database">list URI</a> menu. 
        By default, the file with URIs at each line is stored in the 'Downloads files' folder of your computer, under the name "export_URI_leaf" (ear, plot, etc...).  <br> 
        Because identifiers are meant to be persistent, it is impossible to delete an identifier once created. 
        It is also not possible to reuse an identifier generated in the past for a resource that do not exist anymore. 
        Hence, a new URI will be created if you submit a file twice. You can use any of the URIs created for the considered object. <br>
        You can check what was the last value given to your uri in the list URI menu. 
        Some resources are not incremental (data, images, ...) and thus are using a random URI generated.
